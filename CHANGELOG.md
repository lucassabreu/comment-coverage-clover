## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2022-01-18

### Added

- options `table-type-coverage`, `table-bellow-coverage` and
  `table-above-coverage` to allow users to hide files where the coverage is out
  of a range, that way large projects were most files are above 80% coverage
  can hide the ones bellow that.

between current and previous coverage percentage of lines or methods is

when coverage percentage of lines or methods goes below a threshold

## [0.2.0] - 2021-08-19

### Changed
- examples on readme changed to use `@main` instead of `@v0.1.4`

### Added

### Added
- support for a custom signature on the pull request comment.
- example on readme on how to use artifacts to compare coverage between base
branch and current commit.

### Changed

workflow for user diagnosis, instead of just skipping it.
- release workflow now uses notes from `CHANLOG.md` on release summary.

## [0.1.4] - 2021-08-16
